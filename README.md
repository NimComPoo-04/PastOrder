# Past Order

Tile based thing which can be rendered in both 3d and 2d         ( Easy to design things.)
Allow the player to program the robot.                           ( somesort of simple assembler )
The player and the robot build up a bond, done through speech.   ( Narration system, speech bubble pops up at the bottom of screen and shows text. )
A notebook provided to the player so that they can write things
down, and map out the place as needed. 

Infastrucutre was designed so the AI contigency, even if they wanted
to they could not solve it. The human can't move very fast has to take help of the Ai to move.
the human is heavy can collapse part of the buildings if proper care is not taken.

Ai can't see has to rely on the human to see.

Change in perspective.

1. Ai can move arround
2. Ai can click pictures of environments
3. Ai can bring back information to the human
4. Ai can only see pathways, it has no idea of the real world.

1. Human can't move arround
2. Human can however solve problems.
3. 


So what do we implement:

1. Tile based wolfenstein 3d like rendering
2. Different views for the AI and the human. AI only sees what it has been programmed to see. although it has sentience it is bounded by hardware.
3. Ai can however click pictures which represent the view of the human. what the human sees essentially.
4. The human can interpret what the ai has clicked a picture of and put in subroutines that the Ai executes to get things done.
5. Ultimate goal for the Ai is to get himself and the Human out.
